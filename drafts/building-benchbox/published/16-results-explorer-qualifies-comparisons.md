# How the Results Explorer qualifies comparisons

> The Results Explorer decides what may be displayed, compared, and ranked, and it leaves recorded differences visible. Two timings still have to earn a comparison.

**TL;DR**: BenchBox v0.4.0's [Results Explorer](https://benchbox.dev/results/) is a curated preview that shows timings, compares runs that share enough query evidence, and puts a winner claim only when benchmark, scale factor, phase, and timing coverage line up.[^release] Other recorded differences stay on a Comparability Receipt for the reader to judge. The preview makes the public evidence inspectable.

---

## Which numbers belong together

One published result says 12 seconds. Another says 31. On a results site those two numbers will sit in the same chart whether or not they measured the same work.

The site has to know the benchmark, scale factor, and phase; how many valid query timings they share; whether every query finished; and whether they ran as SQL or DataFrame. The Explorer's job is to keep those facts attached to the numbers.

The [live snapshot](https://benchbox.dev/results/) has a clear case. On TPC-H at scale factor 1, power phase, DataFusion in SQL mode and Polars in DataFrame mode are both ranking-eligible.[^snapshot] They share a workload. Their execution modes differ.

## What we tried

A public results site can be a pre-rendered JSON leaderboard, a hosted submission API, or a static database that the browser queries. We shipped the third.

JSON would start faster. The DuckDB snapshot gives visitors a SQL workbench over the same tables the pages use. A hosted API would make contribution feel instant, and it would be one more service to run. The curated preview and the planned pull-request path need no backend.

We first treated leaderboards as vanity ranking. Visitors still want a platform-by-query matrix on the home page, so ranking stays, and ineligible rows stay visible with a named reason.

Making environment a hard gate was tempting too. On the August 28 snapshot, only 11 of 138 rows record a complete environment, and none record a driver version, so that gate would empty most of the site. We gate benchmark, scale factor, phase, and shared valid timing coverage, and we show the rest as warnings.

## Winner language with warnings, then a suppressed claim

Here is that TPC-H SF1 power pair on the Compare page, using the public short IDs `e3aaa125` (DataFusion SQL) and `9187e38f` (Polars DataFrame):[^compare-urls]

![Compare page for TPC-H SF1 power: DataFusion SQL vs Polars DataFrame. Guardrails say the runs share benchmark, scale, and phase, with five receipt warnings including execution mode. Decision summary still names a winner.](../images/compare_mixed_mode_guardrails.png)

Winner language still appears. The guardrail says the runs share benchmark, scale, and phase, and it lists five receipt warnings, including execution mode. The 1.23x sits next to those warnings.

The receipt lists them:

![Comparability Receipt for the same pair. Benchmark, scale factor, and phase match. Execution mode differs (sql vs dataframe). Driver version is Not recorded and does not add to the warning count.](../images/compare_mixed_mode_receipt.png)

Benchmark, scale factor, and phase match. Execution mode differs: `sql` versus `dataframe`. Both runs omit a driver version, so that field shows "Not recorded" and stays out of the warning count.

Execution mode is a warning. Scale factor is a hard gate. Same engine, same benchmark family, different scale: DuckDB TPC-DS power at SF 1 versus SF 10 (`f552fd5d` and `aa8b0fad`):

![Compare page for DuckDB TPC-DS SF1 vs SF10. Guardrails state that winner claims are suppressed because scale factors differ. Decision summary shows Winner: Not claimed, and a Claims suppressed badge.](../images/compare_scale_mismatch.png)

Per-query evidence stays on the page. The decision summary leaves the winner unclaimed. Scale factor suppressed the ranking language. Execution mode would have left it in place.

| Check | Explorer behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical benchmark | A mismatch suppresses winner and ranking claims |
| Scale factor | A mismatch suppresses winner and ranking claims |
| Test phase | A mismatch suppresses winner and ranking claims |
| Shared valid timing coverage | Insufficient overlap suppresses the comparison claim |
| Platform and driver versions | Recorded differences appear as warnings |
| Validation and execution mode | Recorded differences appear as warnings |
| Environment and run date | Recorded differences appear as warnings |
| Tuning, physical mechanisms, and cost metadata | Recorded differences appear as warnings |
| A field missing for every selected result | Shown as "Not recorded," without increasing the warning count |

Before comparing, the page normalizes benchmark and phase names so aliases and letter case still match.[^compare] A platform-version warning can sit next to a displayed winner claim. The receipt is the list of recorded differences. The reader uses it to judge the comparison.

## Display, comparison, and ranking are separate decisions

A leaderboard that only sorts with `ORDER BY` treats every row as the same kind of evidence. For benchmark results that is usually too strong, so the Explorer splits the work.

```text
result bundle -> admission -> published evidence
                                  |-> display: can this timing be shown?
                                  |-> comparison: is there enough shared query evidence?
                                  `-> ranking: does this row satisfy ranking policy?
```

**Admission** happens before the browser build. A bundle has to pass schema, policy, and corpus checks to enter the published set. That is a publish decision. Ranking comes later.

**Display** asks whether a timing is valid enough to show. Missing, zero, or non-finite timings stay off the chart. Provenance and capability evidence can still be useful.

**Comparison** asks whether selected runs share enough valid query evidence. Each pair needs at least two shared valid query timings, and each selected result has to cover at least half of the query IDs in the selection, with a floor of two.[^eligibility] Requiring identical query sets would empty most comparisons here. Comparing unrelated query subsets would invent a race. We kept a floor: enough shared evidence to compare, while each result still reports its own display geomean.

The coverage check is small, and it runs only after each selected result is itself comparable:

```typescript
const queryIds = [...new Set(results.flatMap(
  (result) => result.display_timings.map((timing) => timing.query_id),
))];
const requiredValidQueriesPerResult = Math.max(2, Math.ceil(queryIds.length * 0.5));
const commonValidQueries = countCommonValidQueries(results, queryIds);

if (commonValidQueries < 2) {
  return {
    comparable: false,
    reason: EXCLUSION_LABELS.insufficient_common_valid_timings ??
      "Selected runs do not share enough valid timings.",
    totalQueries: queryIds.length,
    commonValidQueries,
    requiredValidQueriesPerResult,
  };
}
```

The live exclusion label for that branch is "Selected runs do not share at least two valid query timings." A second check drops a result whose valid timing count is below `requiredValidQueriesPerResult`.

**Ranking** is stricter. Failed queries, unclean validation, thin query coverage, or trust policy can keep a displayable, comparable result out of ranked tables. Named reasons include "One or more queries failed" and "Validation status excludes this result from ranking." A missing row explains itself.

On the August 28 snapshot those layers read 138 admitted results, 134 displayable, 105 comparable, and 55 rankable.[^snapshot]

## A database in the browser

The Explorer's read path is a static file. The released site serves an 8,400,896-byte DuckDB snapshot, and DuckDB-WASM attaches it read-only in the visitor's browser.[^database] The application pages and the SQL workbench query the same tables.

There is no application API, login service, or database server on that path, so the launch architecture stays small. Hosting, the CDN, the build, who can publish, and what is in the snapshot still matter.

The site also serves 138 downloadable JSON bundles, one per snapshot row. DuckDB-WASM holds the metrics the pages show. The JSON is there so a reader can inspect one evidence bundle.

```text
admitted bundles -> static build -> results.duckdb -> DuckDB-WASM -> pages and SQL workbench
                              `-> JSON bundles ------------------> individual downloads
```

A database in the browser costs a cold start that pre-rendered JSON would skip. What it buys is a SQL workbench over the same tables the pages use. Browser tests treat those costs as CI thresholds. DuckDB-WASM cold init is P50 4s / P95 6s, leaderboard data after init P50 1.5s / P95 2.5s, leaderboard render after data P50 0.5s / P95 1s, and query workbench first paint after init P50 0.6s / P95 1.2s.

When the browser cannot attach the snapshot, the site shows an error. A failed load and an empty table are different states.

## A validation pass on zero queries is a non-measurement

Eligibility rules are only as useful as the evidence entering them. Two corpus corrections immediately before v0.4.0 showed why admission requires proof of execution.[^corpus]

On August 24 we withdrew 60 legacy DataFrame bundles. Each reported `summary.validation=passed` after executing zero queries. The check passed because nothing ran.

Each published group needs three platforms. After the 60 withdrawals, ten groups were below that floor, so we also withdrew their remaining 17 SQL bundles. Those 17 were truthful measurements. They came out so a thin group would stop looking like supported comparison coverage.

AMPLab, CoffeeShop, and H2O-DB at SF 0.1 and 1.0, SSB at SF 1.0, and TSBS DevOps at SF 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 left the published corpus. The SF 0.01 groups for AMPLab, CoffeeShop, and H2O-DB remain. A group can return when it has at least three truthful platform results. Fresh DataFrame results also need real validation evidence.

On August 25 a second review found 52 retained bundles whose summary claimed validation `passed` or `partial` while the validation phase was `NOT_RUN`. We changed 23 passed claims and 29 partial claims to `not_run`. Timings and failure records stayed. The bundles remain as capability evidence outside ranking.

Admission now rejects that shape: a passed or partial summary requires a validation phase that ran.

A validation status has to show that the checks passed and that the work ran. If that evidence is missing, leave a gap. After those corrections the snapshot is 56 passed, 30 partial, and 52 not run, with 55 ranking-eligible rows.

## Query the same table the pages use

Start at the [Results Explorer root](https://benchbox.dev/results/) and open **Query**. The workbench exposes `bench.results`, the same result table used by the application.

This query lists the TPC-H SF1 power rows the mixed-mode walkthrough used, including the ranking split:

```sql
SELECT
  platform,
  execution_mode,
  is_ranking_eligible,
  result_id
FROM bench.results
WHERE benchmark = 'tpch'
  AND scale_factor = 1
  AND test_type = 'power'
ORDER BY is_ranking_eligible DESC, execution_mode, platform;
```

On the captured August 28 snapshot, the ranking-eligible rows in that set are DataFusion and Spark in SQL mode, and Polars and PySpark in DataFrame mode.[^snapshot]

To see how 138 admitted results become 55 rankable ones:

```sql
SELECT
  validation_status,
  is_ranking_eligible,
  COUNT(*) AS results
FROM bench.results
GROUP BY validation_status, is_ranking_eligible
ORDER BY validation_status, is_ranking_eligible;
```

That returns 52 not-run and non-ranking results, 30 partial and non-ranking, one passed but non-ranking, and 55 passed and ranking-eligible.

From there, open the two Compare URLs above, or open the same rows from a result detail. Check methodology, provenance, validation, query coverage, and environment. Download the JSON bundle if you want the evidence outside the browser. Run a local copy if you want independent corroboration. Hardware, software, configuration, background load, and data paths can all change the timing.

## What the August 28 snapshot is

The August 28 snapshot is 138 maintainer-run rows with funding `unspecified`. Coverage is uneven: DataFusion 48, Spark 19, DuckDB and Polars 18 each, PySpark 17, SQLite 16, ClickHouse Local and LakeSail one each. Those counts are this snapshot, on the evidence published that day.

Recorded hardware, environment, and funding differences stay visible. A warning-free receipt is still a receipt. The reader decides whether the comparison is useful.

The contribution path is live: package a complete result, then open a pull request against the `published-results` branch of `BenchBox-dev/BenchBox`.[^contributions] Submission CI and a maintainer review the evidence before merge. An accepted bundle does not automatically enter the curated Explorer snapshot or become ranking-eligible. Browse and audit the preview, and [start a discussion](https://github.com/BenchBox-dev/BenchBox/discussions) when a result or explanation needs correction.

The preview refuses some unsupported winner claims, shows why rows are excluded, exposes recorded differences, and lets readers query and download the same public evidence. An honest missing field is more useful than a precise-looking number the corpus cannot support.
