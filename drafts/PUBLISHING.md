# Blog Publishing Workflow

> How to move a blog post from draft to live on [benchbox.dev/blog](https://benchbox.dev/blog/).

## Overview

Blog content is developed under `_blog/` in the single `BenchBox-dev/BenchBox` repository. When a post is ready, archive the final source under `_blog/{series}/published/` and place its ABlog copy under `docs/blog/` in the same change.

The release branch excludes `_blog/` but retains `docs/blog/`. A pull request to `develop` validates the post and assembled public site. GitHub Pages deploys only after the content reaches the protected `release` branch through the release flow.

## Directory Structure

### Editorial source (`_blog/`)

Each blog series has a consistent structure:

```
_blog/
  STYLE_GUIDE.md          # Voice and content rules
  VOICE_REFERENCE.md      # Quick reference for tone
  {series-name}/
    outlines/             # Post outlines and planning
    research/             # Reference materials and notes
    drafts/               # Work-in-progress posts
    published/            # Finalized posts (series archive)
    archived/             # Deprecated versions
```

### Published site source (`docs/blog/`)

Published posts only, with ABlog frontmatter:

```
docs/blog/
  index.rst               # Blog index (postlist + toctree)
  2025-01-22-welcome.md   # Published post
```

## Step-by-Step Publishing Process

### 1. Write the draft

Create the post in `_blog/{series}/drafts/`. Follow the style guide:

- **Voice**: Community-inclusive ("we" not "I"), enthusiastic but grounded
- **Claims**: Back with data, not opinions ("2.3x faster" not "much faster")
- **Platforms**: Neutral, no advocacy ("In this run, [platform A] finished [query] in [time] on [hardware]; [platform B] finished the same query in [time]. Include benchmark, scale, and phase so readers can interpret the measurement.")
- **Methodology**: Show your work, acknowledge limitations

See `_blog/STYLE_GUIDE.md` for the full guide and `_blog/VOICE_REFERENCE.md` for a quick tone reference. Sentence craft is defined in VOICE_REFERENCE. Do not copy it here.

### 2. Editorial check and content validation

Run the automated blog content validator on your draft:

```bash
uv run python scripts/blog_content_validation.py _blog/{series}/drafts/{post}.md
```

Or validate all blog content:

```bash
uv run python scripts/blog_content_validation.py
```

The validator checks:
- **Punctuation** (Error): Prohibits em-dashes (U+2014) and en-dashes (U+2013). Use ASCII hyphens or punctuation.
- **Platform advocacy** (Error): Prohibits platform-winner claims (`"destroys the competition"`, `"clearly superior"`).
- **Voice & tone** (Warning): Flags unsourced superlatives (`"revolutionary"`), vendor critiques (`"needs to fix"`), first-person pronouns (`"I think"`), and banned hedges (`"your mileage may vary"`, `"each platform has different strengths"`).
- **LLM writing tells** (Warning): Flags conversational residue (`"good point"`, `"you're right"`), temporal filler (`"going forward"`), empty throat-clearing (`"in today's digital landscape"`, `"whether you're a seasoned developer"`), AI vocabulary clichés (`"delve"`, `"rich tapestry"`), and formulaic essay conclusions (`"In conclusion"`).
- **Affirmation-denial couplets** (Advisory): Flags singleton denial echoes in post prose.

Exceptions can be annotated with `<!-- content-ok: <category> -->` or `<!-- content-ok -->`.

Before publication, also complete the `_blog/STYLE_GUIDE.md` editorial checklist by hand. Ensure that agent work on our writing (e.g. reviews, style checks, etc.) has not added LLM writing tells to our work.

### 3. Finalize the post

Once the editorial checklist is complete and the post is reviewed:

1. Move (or copy) the draft to `_blog/{series}/published/` for archival
2. Prepare the filename for publication: `YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md`

### 4. Add ABlog frontmatter

The post needs YAML frontmatter for ABlog to recognize it:

```yaml
---
blogpost: true
date: Mon DD, YYYY
author: Joe Harris
tags: tag1, tag2
---

# Post Title

Post content...
```

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `blogpost` | `true` | `true` |
| `date` | `Mon DD, YYYY` | `Jan 22, 2025` |
| `author` | Author name (must match `blog_authors` in `docs/conf.py`) | `Joe Harris` |
| `tags` | Comma-separated | `benchmarking, tpc-h, methodology` |

### 5. Place the post in the published site tree

Copy the finalized post to `docs/blog/` in the same repository:

```bash
cp _blog/{series}/published/{post}.md \
   docs/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md
```

Then adapt relative links for the destination. `_blog/{series}/published/` uses
`../images/{image}.png`, while `docs/blog/` uses `./images/{image}.png`.
Companion-post links in `docs/blog/` must include the companion's date-prefixed
filename. Do not rely on a blind copy when either form appears in the source.

### 6. Register the post in the blog index

Edit `docs/blog/index.rst`. Add the post filename (without extension) to the `toctree`:

```rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :hidden:

   2025-01-22-welcome
   YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}
```

The `postlist::` directive at the top of the index will automatically pick up the new post for the recent posts listing.

### 7. Open the development pull request

Commit the archive copy, published copy, images, and index on a topic branch,
then open a pull request against `develop`. The Documentation workflow builds
Sphinx and ABlog, assembles the public site, runs link checks, and exercises the
public-site browser gate.

```bash
git add _blog/{series}/published/{post}.md \
  docs/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md docs/blog/images/{image}.png \
  docs/blog/index.rst
git commit -m "docs(blog): publish {title}"
```

### 8. Release deploys GitHub Pages

After the development PR merges, carry `develop` through the version-branch
release flow in `docs/operations/release-guide.md`:

```bash
make release-cut VERSION=X.Y.Z
# review and merge the release PR after its required checks
make release-finalize VERSION=X.Y.Z
```

The Documentation workflow builds on `develop` and `release`, but its deploy
job runs only for a push to `release`. It:

1. Builds Sphinx + ABlog documentation
2. Assembles the site: landing page at `/`, docs at `/docs/`, blog at `/blog/`
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

The post will appear at `https://benchbox.dev/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/` and will automatically be included in:

- Recent Posts sidebar widget
- Tag cloud (based on `tags` frontmatter)
- Archives (organized by date)
- RSS feed (`blog/atom.xml`)
