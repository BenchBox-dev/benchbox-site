/**
 * Guardrail: SVG presentation attributes must be written with their real,
 * hyphenated names.
 *
 * SVG attribute names are case-sensitive, and Preact forwards a prop it does
 * not recognise straight to `setAttribute` under the name it was given. So
 * `textAnchor="middle"` reaches the DOM as an attribute called `textAnchor`,
 * which the renderer has no rule for and silently ignores. There is no warning
 * and no visual clue that a value was dropped - only labels that quietly sit
 * where they were never meant to sit.
 *
 * This shipped. Ten chart components used the camelCase spellings across 68
 * occurrences, and the result was that every label meant to be centred on its
 * tick or right-aligned against its gutter was left-aligned instead, running
 * across the plot; every emphasised stroke rendered at the default 1px; every
 * dashed stroke rendered solid - including QueryHistogram's dashed marker,
 * whose entire purpose was to make a query that did not run look different
 * from one that ran very fast.
 *
 * The scan is lexical: it reads source lines rather than rendered attributes,
 * so it cannot see a spread, a computed key, or a name assembled at runtime,
 * and it would object to a camelCase prop of the same name on a component of
 * our own. It is a cheap guard against the mistake that was actually made, not
 * a proof.
