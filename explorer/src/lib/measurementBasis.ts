/**
 * measurementBasis - the explorer's measurement-basis model.
 *
 * Every timing figure on every comparison surface is a function of
 * `(run, passes, statistic)`. Before this module the explorer had exactly one
 * reduction -- the median of measurement passes, precomputed by the pipeline
 * into `display_timings[].display_ms` -- and no vocabulary for saying so. This
 * module names it, generalises it, and enforces the two invariants that make
 * the generalisation safe.
 *
 * INVARIANT 1 - one basis per cross-run comparison.
 *   Reading one run's min against another run's median measures the statistic,
 *   not the engine. A cross-run comparison therefore holds N runs and exactly
 *   ONE basis. Only a within-run comparison may vary the basis per series;
 *   there the engine and hardware are fixed by construction, so the basis
 *   variation is the subject rather than a confound.
 *
 *   This is enforced by the SHAPE of the types, not by a validator. A
 *   `CrossRunSeries` has no basis field, so "series A at median, series B at
 *   min" is not a state this module can represent -- see
 *   `__tests__/measurementBasis.types.test.ts` for the compile-failure proof.
 *   A validator only fires where someone remembered to call it; a type that
 *   cannot express the illegal state removes the bug class from every current
 *   and future call site.
 *
 * INVARIANT 2 - compared geomeans share one query set.
 *   A query missing a pass on one series is excluded from EVERY series'
 *   geomean, not just its own. Geomeans over different query sets are not
 *   comparable. See `sharedQueryGeomeans` in the value-resolution section.
 *
 * Python reference for the default basis:
 *   _project/scripts/explorer_pipeline/transformer.py::_query_display_ms

// token comparison rather than a translation. The read model publishes pass
// selections only; the statistic is a client-side choice and is spelled here.
//
// `median` is the default and is left implicit, so `all_warm:median` and
// `warmup:median` canonicalise to `default` and `warmup` on encode. One
// spelling per basis keeps shared links stable and comparable.
//
// EVERY pass selection takes a statistic suffix, including the single-pass
// ones. An earlier version of this grammar rejected `warmup:min` on the
// reasoning that median and min over a sample of one are the same number --
// but nothing guarantees a sample of one. A throughput run records one warmup
// execution PER STREAM, so `warmup` can select several rows and median and min
// genuinely differ. Dropping the statistic there made `{warmup, min}`
// encode to `warmup` and decode back as `{warmup, median}`, so a shared link
// silently showed different numbers than the sender saw -- exactly the
// must-preserve rule this grammar exists to satisfy.
//
// `default` names one specific basis, so it takes no suffix; write
// `all_warm:min` for the other statistic over the same passes.
//
// Cross-run surfaces carry ONE `basis` parameter. The `bases` list parameter
// belongs only to the within-run route -- the URL grammar mirrors the type
// grammar, so a cross-run link cannot even spell a second basis.
