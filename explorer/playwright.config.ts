/**
 * Browser-functional test harness for the results explorer.
 *
 * Architecture decisions (accepted 2026-04-18) live in
 * `docs/development/browser-test-architecture.md`. In particular:
 *
 * - Tests run against the built `dist/` output, not `vite dev`, so
 *   chunking, the `/results/` base path, and the DuckDB-WASM worker
 *   behavior are all validated as production would see them.
 * - The Playwright `webServer` below serves `dist/` while routing
 *   `/results/data/` to `test-fixtures/.generated/data/`. The curated
 *   corpus under `public/data/` is never mutated.
 * - Chromium runs the full suite and is the blocking gate.
 *   Firefox and WebKit run `@smoke`-tagged coverage only until we have
 *   flake data to graduate them. Promotion criteria are captured in w7
 *   of the implementing TODO and in the architecture note.
 * - There is no production-code seam for failure injection. All error
 *   paths are exercised through `page.route()`, `context.setOffline()`,
 *   permission grants, and download events.
